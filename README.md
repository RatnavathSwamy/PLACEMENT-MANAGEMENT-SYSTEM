# PLACEMENT-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM

A Placement Management System is a web application used to manage student, company, and placement records efficiently.
HTML is used to create user interfaces, while Django (Python) handles the backend logic and validations.
MySQL stores data like students, jobs, and applications, and Django ORM is used to manipulate these records.
The system supports CRUD operations (insert, view, update, delete) securely through web forms.
